Send automatic welcome messages to players.

Commands:
Register player(s) with ".registerwelcome <player>".
Set a specific welcome message for player(s)* with ".welcomemessage <player(s)> <message>". To set where in <message> to put the player's name, use <name> within the string. Ex. ".welcomemessage Brain_Juice Hello, <name>!". Leaving <message> empty will default to "wb <name>", but a space after <playername> is still required.
List the players you send welcome to with ".listwelcome".
Remove player(s)* from your welcome list with ".removewelcome <player>".
Reset players you send welcome to with ".resetwelcome". NOTE: This removes all players from the list, use with caution.
Turn welcome message on (globaly) with ".welcome <true>". Turn welcome message off (globaly) with ".welcome <false>".

* To input more than one player, separate them by commas without spaces in between, Ex. "Brain_Juice,Peace12345,etc".
